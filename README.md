## KNN regressor 
Similar to a KNN classifier (covered in Activity 1.1) in that it finds the K nearest neighbors and estimates the value of the given test point based on the values of its neighbours. The main difference between KNN regression and KNN classification is that KNN classifier returns the label that has the majority vote in the neighborhood, whilst KNN regressor returns the average of the neighborsâ€™ values
 
## Prediction Uncertainty with Bootstrapping
Use the bootstrapping technique to quantify the uncertainty of predictions for the KNN regressor.

## Ridge Regression with L2 Regularisation 

## Multiclass Perceptron

## Logistic Regression vs. Bayesian Classifier
